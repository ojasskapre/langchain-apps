# Langchain Applications

## Research Assistant

This project aims to create a research assistant using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. The assistant can generate comprehensive research reports based on user-provided topics. The system utilizes web scraping, text summarization, and search query generation to gather and analyze information from various online sources.

## Chat With Video

This project is a Streamlit based application allows users to upload videos, transcribe their audio using OpenAI's Whisper, and create embeddings with LangChain-OpenAI and store the embeddings in Pinecone Vector DB for further querying. Users can then chat with the video content by selecting transcribed videos and asking questions.
